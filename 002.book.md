## tl;dr

Your goal is to get to the last step, Generate `All`, under the **Generate** tab, without any errors.
<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/aclpub_goal.png "Image of last Generate tab view, with 'All' button producing successful proceedings.")</kbd>

:point_right: :point_right: It has to look good and abide by the ACL paper and style guidelines. It's up to you to make sure it does. :point_left: :point_left: :ok_hand: :thumbsup:

### Important Details
1. Your Softconf workshop abbreviation is [on this spreadsheet, under "Softconf"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing).

2. Check [that spreadsheet](hhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing) to make sure your workshop name is the **precise name** of the workshop, in order to get the ISBN.

3.  Based on the finalized workshop name, we will [update the spreadsheet to give you your ISBN](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing). 

4. Papers should be in A4 format.

5. Program times should be in 24-hour format.

## Introduction

You will need your ACL ID Prefix (henceforth, called **Bibtex URL**), and your ISBN number.
You can find those [in the ACL 2018 Workshops google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing), once you have verified your workshop name.  ISBNs are assigned based on the name of your workshop, so make sure your name is good. 

You should be able to produce your proceedings entirely within the START manager console.  Once your book builds without error using the `All` button under the
Generate tab, let the publications chairs know by e-mailing us at
[acl-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:acl-pub-chairs@googlegroups.com).
We will collect the books online using START. There is no need to
e-mail us any zipped files.

We will update this page periodically with ACL 2018-specific details and answers to frequently
asked questions as they arise. If you encounter any problems with this
process, you can email us, but also remember this is all volunteer-run.

## Instructions

To get to the Softconf ACL Proceedings Generator: 
 - Go to your workshop's softconf website:  https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}, where ${WSAbbreviation} is your [Softconf workshop abbreviation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing).
 - Go to the Publication Console (/pub):  https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}/pub
 - Under **Conference Program**, follow the `ACLPUB` link.   
   <kbd>
   ![alt text](howto_images/aclpub.png "ACLPUB link.")
   </kbd>  
   This will bring you to the url:  https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/${WSAbbreviation}/pub/scmd.cgi?scmd=ACLPUB
 - Now you should see the `ACLPUB Proceedings Generator`.
   <kbd>![alt text](howto_images/start_tabs.png "Left to Right START Tabs.")</kbd>

The Softconf ACL Proceedings Generator creates two things:

   -  **Book proceedings pdf, based in latex**   
   The files used in the generation of the book proceedings are shown in [Table 1](#table-1--files-used-in-book-proceedings-generation).

   -  **Online proceedings, based in html**
   Compiling the book proceedings end-to-end also produces the online proceedings.  The files used in the generation of the online proceedings are shown in [Table 2](#table-2--files-used-in-online-proceedings-generation).
   
Next we walk through how to use the Softconf ACL Proceedings Generator to create the book proceedings and the online proceedings.

[9: Generate!](#step-9--generate-tab-trophy-trophy)

## Step 1: Generate Tab

### Check Copyright Signatures

Your first job is to check that your authors signed their copyright forms via START. To create the `copyright-signatures` file, go on the **Generate tab**, and click on the **Copyright Signatures** button.

<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/generate_example.png "Image of last Generate tab view, with 'Copyright Signatures' circled.")</kbd>

At this point, click on the "Download copyright signatures" link to download the copyright signatures.

DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE; it is a legal record. Please quickly review it to make sure that appropriate signatures have been provided for all papers. For any papers with missing, incomplete (e.g., initials) or inappropriate signatures (e.g., "Mickey Mouse"), contact the authors to get the proper copyright. Make sure that the authors' signed affiliation matches their START affiliation. If not, the author may need to update their information in START. They also may have performed the work while at a different affiliation from their current one. If this is the case, have them write a note in the affiliation box of the copyright form something like "This work done entirely while affiliated with XYZ" and provide the address for XYZ. The publications chairs need to extract hardcopy signatures from those papers' authors in time for their papers to be included.

If authors send you an externally signed copyright form, pass it along to the conference publication chairs, who will give it to Min-Yen, or the current ACL Web Anthology editor.

You may see a "Warning" message in the upper right corner of the website. 
<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/start_warning.png "Image of "Warning" notification in START portal.")</kbd>
This means that that authors have updated their START profiles (most commonly their affiliation). You will need to refresh in order for the changes to be reflected in the copyright signatures, and in the html order file later on.



### Get Rough Cut
Now **click on the Draft button**. 

<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/generate_draft.png "Image of last Generate tab view, with 'Draft' circled.")</kbd>

The command compiles all papers into a single pdf, adds margin markings and generates a first rough cut of the proceedings, `book.pdf`.  Click **Download Draft** to download after it is generated.

Count the papers to make sure you're not missing any (e.g., due to an author's failure to submit camera-ready copy).

If this or any of the other generation buttons in this tab fail (you will know, because a **zip** and **log** will appear, but not the **Download** quick link), check the log file to get a pointer to another, more specific log file, e.g,. program.log. This file will be located in the zip. Download it, and find the referenced log to see the actual issue. 

### Check and Fix PDF files

Flip through the rough cut.  
* Are the authors correct?  
* Is their contact information easily findable?  
* Is there an error or issue in how figures and tables show up?  
* Are things presented well for black-and-white?  
* Do all the fonts in the papers display and print correctly?  
* Did the authors follow the style file (font sizes, font faces, placement and style of captions)?  
* Is the paper within the page limits?  
* (We will deal with the margins in the next step)
* Etc...

If any of these things are amiss, you will need to ask the author to reupload a new final submission. If the submission portal is closed, have the authors email you a copy. You can upload it by going to **Monitor Final Submissions**, then click **Get Final Form** for the paper in question. From "Monitor Final Submissions", you can also see the date and time when the authors last uploaded their versions. 

<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/final_submissions.png "Image of homepage, with 'Monitor Final Submissions' circled.")</kbd>


### Check and Fix Paper Information

Now you will check that the information provided by authors are correct and correctly formatted. Clicking **Shipout** will generate a new version of the proceedings, but with an author index at the end and without the draft margin lines. 
<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/generate_shipout.png "Image of last Generate tab view, with 'Shipout' circled.")</kbd>


Look at the author index and ensure that:  
*   Capitalization of authors should be as in BibTeX. Example:
    > Piet Q. van Oostrum, Jr.
*   There are no separate entries for "Doe, Jane" and "Doe, J." That is, if the same author contributed to multiple papers, make sure their name is written the same way each time in the various paper information.
* The first or last names are not all in caps.
* If present, the middle initial is formatted `Last, First M.` and not `M. Last, First`

You can edit the way the author name appears in your proceedings using **Edit Author and User Information**. 
<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/edit_author_info.png "Image of homepage, with 'Edit Author and User Information' circled.")</kbd>

Capitalization of titles should be exactly as in BibTeX, since these data will be used to create public BibTeX files for use by anyone. Specifically:  
*   Always capitalize the first word of the title, and any word following a colon.
*   Except as above, lowercase the following "little words": articles, prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, and the infinitive marker "to."
*   Capitalize all content words. This includes hyphenated words: `Mixed-Case`.
*   If a content word is inherently capitalized and must retain capitalization even in a lowercase style (such as ACL's prescribed style `acl.bst`), "protect" it by surrounding at least the capital letters with curly braces: `{E}nglish`, `{C}homsky`, `{IBM}`, `{CFG}s`, `{HMM}s` (or if you prefer, `{English}`, `{Chomsky}`, `{IBM}`, `{CFGs}`, `{HMMs}`).
*   Use LaTeX math mode where appropriate: `An $O(n^2)$ Algorithm for $n$-gram Smoothing`.
*   Use [LaTeX commands for accents](http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/teTeX/latex/latex2e-html/ltx-401.html).





## Step 2:  Margins Tab
[Jump to Step 3](#step-3--dwnl-templates-tab)

Going to this tab should display a table of the first 10 papers.  To see all the papers, change the `Page length` value at the top of the table to the largest value possible.  

The draft book created in the last step includes a margin frame and rulers that should make it easy to detect how much each paper must be shifted to fit. 

The authors should have already checked their margins at submission time of thier final versions, but if they did not, you can edit it here. Look especially at page 2 of each paper. If the text doesn't fit within the frame, look at the top of the text to see how many millimeters it should be moved, and add a margin specification.

You can change margins in this tab by clicking on the cell all the way to the right -- this will bring up the Margins adjustment, circled in red image right :arrow_right:. 

<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/margins.png "The Margins Tab.")</kbd>

The format of the line is

> <pre>x-axis-movement y-axis-movement[,more-options]
> </pre>

Positive values move up and to the right. Negative values move down and to the left. For example, if the top of the text is `14mm` below the top of the frame, according to the ruler, then enter the values `0 14`.

Common values are:

> <pre>0 6
> 0 -12
> </pre>

Horizontal correction is rarely needed. In an exceptional case, you may need to shrink a page or clip it against a specified bounding box or something. You can do this by appending some options that will be passed to the [LaTeX includegraphics command](http://www.cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/grfguide.pdf), which slurps in the page as a graphical object:

> <pre>0 6,scale=0.95
> 0 10,bb=0 90 612 792,clip
> </pre>

After entering the margin movement information, you can regenerate the rough cut (just click on the `Draft` button in [the Generate tab](#step-1-generate-tab) again and check that everything is at the right place. Iterate until convergence.

Alternatively, for each paper, go to the left column and click on the rightmost `Edit Submission`.  This is circled in red image left :arrow_left:.  This will bring you to the authors' final uploaded paper, where you can take a look at the paper, and adjust the margins in the submission page for each.


## Step 3:  Dwnl Templates Tab 
[Jump to Step 4](#step-4--templates-tab)

(may be able to skip) 

This step is if you have logos and/or know what you are doing and want to edit your proceedings offline. 

<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/dwnl_templates.png "The Download/Upload Tab.")</kbd>
 
Download the ACLPUB `.zip` file, add in your sponsorship logos, rezip, and upload.  

To download all the current files, click on the "Current ACLPub Templates", circled here in red.  You will receive a zip file with all the files for your proceedings compilation.  If you don't want to use START, and know what you're doing, here is where you would upload all your files.

Once downloaded and unzipped, **you can edit all `tex` files here directly**.  You also add sponsorship logos here, via `\includegraphics` and ![alt text](howto_images/graphicspath.png "Latex instructions to set graphics path"), and referencing the images added to the directory.

When you are done, zip the edited directory back up again, and upload it again by clicking the `Choose File` button ("ACLPUB templates zip name"), the "Import template".

You can also edit all `.html` files using the CDROM `.zip`


## Step 4:  Templates Tab
[Jump to Step 5](#step-5--order-tab)


<kbd>![alt text](howto_images/templates.png "The Templates Tab.")</kbd>


This is where you edit most of the front matter and online information for the proceedings. If you have imported a modified template from [Step 3](#step-3--dwnl-templates-tab), it will appear changed here. To check how well each part compiles, press the buttons in the Preview Templates table.

:point_right: :point_right: **Remember to hit `Save templates` at the top when you edit the embedded files.**

Select among the subtabs within this tab -- Sections, Settings, Headers, and CDROM -- to expose all the embedded files for editing.

<dl>

        <dd> `unified-authors.html` (Publication Chairs Only), `mainindex.html` (Publication Chairs Only)</dd>
      </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

`program.tex` will follow what is given in the `order` file ([Step 5](#step-5--order-tab)).  You edit/customize `program.tex` in [the Program Tab (Step 7)](#step-7--the-program-tab), and you can edit/customize `toc.tex` in [the TOC Tab (Step 8)](#step-8--toc-tab).  For editing/customizing the HTML, you'll need to do it offline.

### Title Page (Sections Subtab)

   [titlepage.tex](assets/files/current_templates/titlepage.tex) 

   Edit to reflect your title page. For uniformity, the following format is recommended for all workshops, demos, tutorials, etc:  
   * Acronym of the main conference, regardless of workshop (e.g., "NAACL HLT 2018")  
   * Title without iteration (e.g., "First", "Thirteenth") or 'Workshop of' 
   * Proceedings and the iteration; iteration not needed for main conference proceedings.
   * Some examples:
   
| Title | Proceedings | 
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| The 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies | Proceedings of the Conference Volume 1 (Long Papers) | 
| The 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies | Proceedings of the Demonstrations Session | 
| The 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies | Proceedings of the Student Research Workshop | 
| Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications | Proceedings of the Thirteenth Workshop | 


### Copyright Page (Sections Subtab)

  [copyright.tex](assets/files/current_templates/copyright.tex) 

  Fill out the ISBN here.  This can be found [in the Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing).  This is also where to use the \includegraphics tex call for sponsor logos, which we uploaded in [Step Two](#step-2--dwnl-templates-tab).

### Preface Page (Sections Subtab)

  [preface.tex](assets/files/current_templates/preface.tex) 

The general introductory, welcome message from the organizers goes here.
  
### Organizers Page (Sections Subtab)

  [organizers.tex](assets/files/current_templates/organizers.tex)
  
This is where you list all the people who made this possible -- Organizers, Program Committee, Advisory Board, Panel, etc.

### Citation Stamp (Settings Subtab)

   [citation-stamp.tex](assets/files/current_templates/citation-stamp.tex)

This is the official citation for your proceedings, which gets stamped on the bottom of the first page of each author's work in your proceedings. Make sure the ciation stamp doesn't go into the margins (you can visually verify this in the generated **Draft** output. You can abbreviate your proceedings title, if you must shrink it). Make sure to change the date too.

### Spine (Settings Subtab)

   [spine.tex](assets/files/current_templates/spine.tex)

This is for the spine on book proceedings if printed.

### Book (Settings Subtab)

   [book.tex](assets/files/current_templates/book.tex)

This is the main file enveloping your proceedings.

### Program (Headers Subtab)

   [program.tex.head](assets/files/current_templates/program.tex.head)

Edit your program header if desired. 

### TOC (Headers Subtab)

   [toc.tex.head](assets/files/current_templates/toc.tex.head)

Edit your Table of Contents header if desired.

### HTML Pages (CDROM Subtab)

   [index.html.head](assets/files/current_templates/index.html.head)

   [authors.html.head](assets/files/current_templates/authors.html.head)

   [program.html.head](assets/files/current_templates/authors.html.head)
   
   [standard.css](assets/files/current_cdrom/standard.css)
  
These files are used to create the `index.html`, `authors.html`, and `program.html` files for the Online proceedings.  Edit the headers here so that they point to your conference/website.

## Step 5:  Order Tab
[Jump to Step 6](#step-6--cdrom-tab-online-proceedings-tab)
   
This tab creates the file called `order`.
 
The `order` file is used to format and order the papers in the
proceedings, in the schedule, and also to generate the handbook. 
The latter can be a
complex task, making sure that the schedule is formatted correctly and
consistently, and pulling together times across workshops (like the
student research workshop and the main proceedings). Since this is
done in LaTeX, it's important that the schedules be formatted to be
computer-readable.

You can either:
  1. Use the Schedule Maker, to figure out your schedule, and get the `order` file created from that. 
  2. Use the text in the textbox as the `order` file, editing directly using the given markup.

If you use the ScheduleMaker tool, the order file is generated automatically and should be to spec. 
* The **Visual Ordering** lists all the papers accepted to your track. 
* Use the **Add Day** button to designate the day (a `*` will start this line in the generated order file)
* Use the **Add Session** for sessions, including morning/afternoon sessions, poster sessions, numbered sessions (a `=` will start this line in the generated order file)
* Rearrange the papers within each section. Expand the '+' and add a time. (the paper number will start this line in the generated order file)
* Use the **Add Generic Speech** for opening remarks, coffee breaks, lunch breaks, etc (a `!` will start this line in the generated order file)
* Don't use `&` or `#` in the titles for sessions and speeches

If you edit by the `order` file by hand, remember:
-  Times should be specified in 24-hour format (implicit AM/PM):

         ! 12:00--13:30 Lunch

**This is very important for things like the digital handbook!**

-  Time ranges should be fully specified, with two dashes in between (and no spaces). Don't put just the start time.

         17 9:00--9:30 # A really great paper

-  Do not put time ranges in parentheses

## Step 6:  CDROM Tab (Online Proceedings Tab)
[Jump to Step 7](#step-7--program-tab)

<kbd> ![alt text](howto_images/cdrom.png "The CDROM Tab.") </kbd>

You will need to fill out this tab with the correct values for your volume, 
many of which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing).
As an example, here are the values used for the NAACL 2018 long paper main conference proceedings:


| Field           | Value                         | 
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Abbreviation          | N18-1          | 
|    Type	|  Main Conference |
|    Title	|  The 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers) |
|    URL	|          http://naacl2018.org/ |
|    Book Title	|  Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers) |
|    Month	|  June |
|    Year       |   2018 |
|    Location	|  New Orleans, Louisiana |
|    Publisher	|  Association for Computational Linguistics |
|    Chair 1	|  Marilyn Walker (University of California, Santa Cruz) |
|    Chair 2	|  Heng Ji (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute)  |
|    Chair 3	|  Amanda Stent (Bloomberg) |
|    Chair 4	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Chair 5	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Chair 6	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Chair 7	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Chair 8	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Chair 9	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Chair 10	|  TOBEFILLED-Jill Burstein (Educational Testing Service) |
|    Bibtex URL	|  http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1%03d |

**The correct value** for `Bibtex URL` can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LBaP9ddI-5XGDvDvB0xSxgaLgz438P5MlGNVKtQZS8w/edit?usp=sharing).

The `Bibtex URL` uses **8** characters to identify the conference/workshop and paper, after the `http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/` prefix.  **You must make sure that the Bibtex URL provides for these 8 characters**, but adding %03d (3 digits) or %02d (2 digits). 

The first values after the hyphen identify the workshop or ACL event.
The remaining values specify the paper ID. 

For example, in an NAACL main event in year 2018 (long papers, short papers, industry papers, demos, student research workshop, and tuorials), the 8 characters will begin with `N18-`.  This stands for "NAACL, 2018". For a workshop in year 2018, the 8 characters will begin with `W18-`.  This stands for "Workshop, 2018".  

For workshops, we provide you with enough prefix that you need to specify just %02d additional following digits.  For example, if you're the 5th workshop listed, your bibtex URL will look like this: 

    Bibtex URL	    http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-05%02d

By specifying 2 more digits, we can create a paper for aclweb.  E.g., the first workshop paper in the 5th workshop in 2016 is http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-0501.pdf.

For full ACL proceedings, specifying http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1%03d, we can create, e.g., http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1000.pdf (compare: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1000.pdf).  
       
The **abbreviation** should be standardized to match the bibtex urls. E.g., with a bibtex url of `http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1%03d` the abbreviation should be `N18-1`; similarly, with a bibtex url of `http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-05%02d` the abbreviation should be `W18-05`, and 
 a bibtex url of `http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-1%03d` the abbreviation should be `S18-1`.

The **Book Title** value should be the same as the **Title** but with "Proceedings of" at the beginning. The main volumes (long, short, industry, papers, demos, SRW, tutorials) should share a similar title and book title, e.g,. 
> Title: The 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop  
> Book Title: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Student Research Workshop

and   
> Title: The 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Demonstrations  
> Book Title: Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Demonstrations

**Note:** The format of the titles in the CDROM tab are different from how it is printed on `titlepage.tex` on purpose.

## Expert Route

1. Download the ACLPUB and CDROM zipfiles in the **Dwnl Templates** tab, [download the compilation scripts here](assets/files/create_book), edit the files and compile all the things perfectly, re-zip, and upload.  See the [Dwnl Templates](#step-3--dwnl-templates-tab) section for more.

Here is a flowchart to illustrate the process. The ACLPUB scripts in this download use makefiles that roughly follow the steps in this flowchart.

<kbd>![](howto_images/aclpub_howto.png)</kbd>
  
2. After you've uploaded, generate `All`, under the **Generate** tab, without any errors.  See the [Step 9:  Generate! Tab](#step-9--generate-tab-trophy-trophy) section for more.

## What to Look Out For

### Paper formatting

Please make sure that all of your papers meet the camera-ready standards as laid
out <a href="camera-ready-faq.html">in this document</a>. In particular, there are four main
areas of compliance you should look for:

1. *Margins*. Papers should fit entirely within the margins prescribed by the
   conference booklet.   See [Step 2: Margins above.](#step-2--margins-tab)

1. *Black & White readability*. Papers can contain color images, charts, and
    figures, but they should all be interpretable when printed or viewed in grayscale.

1. *References*. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the formatting of
   the References section.
   
1. *Metadata*. Please make sure there are no obvious problems with the
   formatting of names in the metadata for each paper (which is
   viewable from the proceedings draft index). In particular, authors
   should be aware that their names
   [will be formatted according to how they have entered it](camera-ready-faq.html#name-formatting)
   on their Softconf unified user info page.
   
### Schedules

You will need to produce a schedule for your workshop/session while
generating the proceedings.  **The schedule deadline is the same as
the book deadline!** Please follow the instructions in this document, or take a look at this
[sample order file from SSST-7](files/sample-order.txt). 
Schedules are built from the proceedings `order` file, which you can either
edit manually in START's provided textbox or which you can create with the Excel-based `Schedule Maker` tool.

See the [Order](#step-5--order-tab) section above for more.

### ISBN and Bibtex url

ISBNs are assigned based on the precise name of your workshop.  Make sure to figure out the precise name, and send it to the pub chairs or upload it in the spreadsheet, in order to have the pub chairs give you your ISBN. 

The ISBN is placed in the bottom of your `copyright.tex` file.

The Bibtex url should be put in place in [Step 6:  Online Proceedings Tab (CDROM)](#step-6--cdrom-tab-online-proceedings-tab), to aid generation of the online proceedings.

### Logos  

Sponsors for your workshop/conference should have their logos appear on the `copyright.tex` page.  [Jump to Step 3](#step-3--dwnl-templates-tab) to make sure those are uploaded and included.

### Fonts and Unicode

   The following warnings may appear when processing papers by authors from Japan:

   <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Error: Unknown character collection 'Adobe-Japan1'
   Error: Couldn't find a font to substitute for 'Ryumin-Light-Identity-H' ('Adobe-Japan1' character collection)
   Error: Couldn't find a font to substitute for 'GothicBBB-Medium-Identity-H' ('Adobe-Japan1' character collection)</font>

   Also, the following warnings may appear when processing papers by authors from China:

   <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">Error: Unknown character collection 'Adobe-GB1'
   Error: Couldn't find 'GBK-EUC-H' CMap file for 'Adobe-GB1' collection
   Error: Unknown CMap 'GBK-EUC-H' for character collection 'Adobe-GB1'
   Error: Unknown font tag 'F1'</font>

   Make sure that fonts are embedded in the pdf.
   Make sure that the author started their LaTeX file with

   > <pre>\documentclass[11pt]{article}
   > \usepackage{times}</pre>
