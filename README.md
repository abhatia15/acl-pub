# Publications-related documentation for *ACL conferences

This repository is the official source of information (including [templates](paper_styles/) for those involved with the publications process for \*ACL conferences.
There is information here for book chairs, publication chairs, and authors.
It improves over time as people update and add to it, so during or after your conference experience, please take some time to [issue a pull request](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-pub/pulls) with any new information or clarifications you may have come across.
In particular, changes to the style templates should be preserved here.
